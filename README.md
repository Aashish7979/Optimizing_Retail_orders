# Optimizing_Retail_orders

**Project Title:** Optimizing Retail orders and providing Insights with AI Variant

**Problem Statement:
**
In today’s data-driven world, businesses must leverage their data effectively to make informed decisions and gain a competitive edge. AI Variant, a forward-thinking organization, aims to explore advanced analytics to uncover actionable insights from sales data. Using the Kaggle API for seamless data acquisition and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for structured data management and analysis, this project will focus on deriving valuable insights to enhance business performance. The primary objective is to analyze sales data to identify top-performing products, regional sales trends, growth patterns over time, and profit-driving subcategories.

**Scope of the Project:**

The project involves a comprehensive end-to-end workflow, starting from data extraction to actionable insights generation. The key steps include:

**Data Acquisition:**

Leverage Python and the Kaggle API to access a relevant sales dataset from Kaggle’s repository.

Preprocess and clean the data to ensure compatibility with SSMS.

**Data Integration:**

Establish a connection between Python and SSMS.

Upload the cleaned dataset into a structured table in SSMS, creating the necessary schema to store and manage data effectively.

**Data Analysis in SSMS:**

Utilize SQL queries to conduct detailed analyses and answer the following business questions:

Identify the top 10 highest revenue-generating products.

Determine the top 5 highest-selling products in each region.

Compare month-over-month (MoM) sales growth for 2022 and 2023.

For each category, identify the month with the highest sales.

Determine the subcategory with the highest profit growth in 2023 compared to 2022.

**Deliverables:**

The project deliverables are structured into three phases:

**Phase 1: ** Data Preparation

Python script to:

Access the Kaggle API and fetch the dataset.

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.

Save the cleaned data in a format compatible with SSMS (e.g., CSV).

A structured SQL schema for the dataset in SSMS, ensuring data integrity and optimized query performance.

**Phase 2:** Data Analysis

SQL queries addressing the following business questions:

Top 10 highest revenue-generating products.

Top 5 highest-selling products in each region.

Month-over-month sales growth comparison for 2022 and 2023.

The highest sales month for each category.

Subcategories with the highest profit growth in 2023 compared to 2022.

Documented results of each query with supporting data outputs.

**Phase 3:** Insights and Reporting

Final project report including:

Overview of the problem statement and methodology.

Insights derived from each analysis.

Business recommendations based on the findings.

**Project Workflow:**

**Planning:**

Define the dataset requirements and business questions.

Set up necessary tools (Python environment, Kaggle account, SSMS instance).

**Execution:**

Fetch and preprocess data using Python.

Upload the data to SSMS and create the required table schema.

Execute the predefined SQL queries to answer business questions.

**Review and Presentation:**

Verify the accuracy of SQL query outputs.

Compile insights into a comprehensive report.

**Technical Tools and Frameworks:**

**Data Acquisition:** Python, Kaggle API.

Data Management: SSMS for database creation and SQL queries.

**Expected Outcomes:**

A robust pipeline for fetching, cleaning, and managing sales data.

A clear understanding of the company’s top-performing products and regions.

Insights into sales trends and growth patterns over time.

Identification of high-performing categories and subcategories.

A professionally documented analysis to support strategic decision-making at AI Variant.
